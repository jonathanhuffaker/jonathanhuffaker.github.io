Nash Bike Tirp is my back-end capstone project for Evening Cohort 2 at NSS.  I developed this project to be used as a trip preparation tool for cyclists to be able to plan/view their route prior to their departure, and give them the location of the closest bike racks in location to their arriving destination.  For this project I used Google maps bicycling layer API and data.nashville.gov â€™s bike rack data for visibility into metro owned, some privately owned, and art installation bike racks in Davidson County.  This project was built using ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
