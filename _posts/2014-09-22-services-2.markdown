  A movie app developed with two of my colleagues at NSS using OMDb's API.  We built this app to allow for a user to search movies, add movies they plan to watch, and rate movies that they have on their watched list.

  For this project we used HTML, Javascript, CSS, Require.JS, Q, Bootstrap, and LoDash.
